# Predictive Analytics for Student Academic Performance

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail
based on the number of hours studied.

## Dataset
- student_data.csv
- Features:
  - StudyHours (independent variable)
- Target:
  - Pass (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

## Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform feature selection
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Deliverable
- Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating feature selection, model training, and evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
